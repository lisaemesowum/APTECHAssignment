So lets explain this area of service
so now service class is like a helper / managers they talk to models and handle the business rules

example when a customer adds to cart , the CartService makes sure its added properly.

so ShoppingCart classes stores data(products + quantities).

then CartService is where you put the rules and actions of  your app
or think of it like
CartService like the cashier or assistant that helps you add, remove , calculate totals etc.


so cartService wraps the shopping cart model and expose methods to add/ remove/view items
CustomerController calls cartService , not directly the shopping cart so because if it calls shoppingCart directly, then the controller itself will be handling business logic like checking stock, applying discounts updating.



Service > does the work. or like a WareHouse Manager
